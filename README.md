# Spatial Mortality ‚Äî Bayesian CAR Models & Post-COVID Dynamics

This repo collects figures and references from ongoing projects on **county-level U.S. mortality**, including:
- Bayesian **spatio-temporal** modeling with CAR priors,
- Post-COVID and ‚Äúafter-COVID‚Äù effects by **age √ó sex**,
- Spatial clustering and **baseline risk** (œï) surfaces,
- Demographic context (e.g., changing racial composition).

Methods and full results are detailed in the peer-reviewed papers below:

## Highlights

### 1) Regional patterns in male mortality curves
![3 Hierarchical Clusters of Male Mortality Curves](./figs/mhc_3_map.png)

**What it shows:** a data-driven clustering of **male mortality curve shapes** across counties, revealing broad west/central vs east patterning and local anomalies.  
**Takeaway:** strong geography remains after adjusting for age effects; this motivates spatial pooling and CAR structure in the hierarchical model. (Modeling approach described in the paper‚Äôs methods section.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2) COVID vs. Post-COVID shifts by age & sex

  <img src="./figs/postcovid_impact_mf.jpg" alt="Post-COVID impact by age and sex" width="420"/>
</div>

**What it shows:** estimated **coefficients** for COVID (2020‚Äì2021) and **after-COVID** (2022‚Äì2023) by age and sex. In the paper, COVID effects shrink once post-COVID is included, and patterns differ by sex/age. See the discussion around the COVID indicators and Figures 6‚Äì7 in the manuscript. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 3) Spatial baseline risk (œï): example stratum
![Mean Spatial Effect (phi) ‚Äì females 45‚Äì49](./figs/phi_by_county_F10.jpeg)

**What it shows:** posterior mean of **œï** (county-level baseline deviation) for a female age band. Note the broad corridor of elevated risk across the Mountain West and northern Plains‚Äîconsistent with a ‚Äúbelt‚Äù seen in suicide literatures and our own spatial random-effect maps (see mapping figures and discussion). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 4) Demographic drift: proportion white by sex over time
![Proportion White by Year, Sex Panels](./figs/race_raw_trend.png)

**What it shows:** declining **proportion white** over 2000‚Äì2020 in both sexes, with different baselines by panel. Useful as a context plot for demographic composition changes referenced in the covariate section. (Derived from RaceRaw; see figure panels.) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## üß† Modeling (brief)

We model deaths with a **binomial likelihood** and a **logit** link:
\[
\logit(\theta_{kt}) = \mathbf{x}_{kt}^\top \beta + \psi_{kt},\quad 
\psi_{kt} = \phi_k + (\alpha + \delta_k)\cdot \tfrac{t - \bar t}{T}
\]
with **CAR priors** on the spatial intercept \(\phi\) and county-specific slope deviations \(\delta\), plus weakly-informative priors on fixed effects. This supports **spatial smoothing** and **time-trend pooling** across neighboring counties. (Full details, priors, and estimation notes‚Äîincluding CARBayesST implementation‚Äîare in the paper.) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

We examine two families of questions:

1) **Socio-economic models of suicide (2010‚Äì2023):** BA%, HPI, marriage rate, household size, %White, poor mental health days, etc., with COVID and after-COVID indicators. See the covariate table and results figures. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
2) **Mental-health indicators vs outcomes:** MHA **positive screen rates** (depression, suicidal ideation, PTSD, psychosis risk) paired with **all-cause** and **suicide** outcomes, stratified by age √ó sex. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
